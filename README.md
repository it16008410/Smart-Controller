  Today, Common areas face a huge problem of maintain the comfortable situation inside the area. Among these maintain the temperature inside the area, maintain the student inside the area, count number of students inside the area and display how many students inside then understand table are full or not etc.   We proposed a system for resolve many problems inside area. We already included the motion detectors for our system. Firstly, system can detect peoples in the common area. AC automatic turn on when the students in the area and turn off when the student not in the common area. Then we can understand how many motions inside the area. It is useful in many ways. So, we get an example high amount of student in the area, then AC can’t maintain the temperature as well. Then AC Speed must be increased for maintain the temperature. Air conditioner speed adjust with the number of students in the common area. Then easily maintain the temperature. Second example is full amount of student in the area, then we can notice like “common area is full” in front of the common area. As a result of this students can understand there is no space available at that movement. Additional student not allowed to the inside, then already inside student can continue their works easily.   When people are not there the air conditioner continues working unless otherwise manually turned off, as a result human negligence results in higher electricity bills. 
  Some Air conditioner system not sensitive with conditioning area temperature. It is generating only Ac temperature. When the more people in the area Ac can’t control the temperature Automatically.  
  In addition, we noticed a huge problem is polluted air breathing. It is mainly affected to infect more diseases in now people aren’t aware of the quality of air that they breathe and are largely unaware of the diseases they get due to poor quality air. In this stage world mainly face to the Air quality problem. We will resolve these problems in our proposed system. 
  In addition, most people face a problem of hearing bad noising in common areas. People can’t advise and find for the people who doing bad noise in the common areas. It is a big problem in common areas 
 
 Main Objectives  
  1.Create a system application and connect all the data given by the sensors to the system application. Control the common area automatically with functions that we hope to solve. 
 
 Specific Objectives  
    1.Create a hardware circuit to combine all hardware accessories. 
    2.Analyze the data and indicate the analyzed data on the system application. 
    3.Follow the analyzed data and give the suitable solutions for the situation. 
    
 Expected Outcomes  
    Detect people’s motions and Count How many people’s in the inside the common area by a suitable method or sensor.  
    Automatically turn off, turn on, increase and decrease the compressor speed with the count of peoples. 
    Maintaining real temperature inside the common area. 
    Find the bad gases and bad conditions of the air. Give analytical percentage of some gases in the air.   
    Detect the bad noise of the people and it is automatically generating the alarm sound when the noise exceeded the noise limit.  
    Alarm and give some instructions to follow for the prevent the bad condition of the air and maintaining the noise limit.
